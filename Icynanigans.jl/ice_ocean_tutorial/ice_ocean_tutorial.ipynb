Both of these packages are designed for use with GPUs in mind, but for this tutorial we will only use CPUs since our problem will be fairly small. Both of these packages were written by scientists at the Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA: https://clima.caltech.edu), and thus use very similar conventions.\n",
